# Snake Game in Python using Turtle

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Turtle module for graphics. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food pellets and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.

## Features
- Snake movement controlled by arrow keys
- Food pellets randomly generated on the screen
- Score tracking
- Game over when the snake collides with the walls or itself

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alecbideri/snake-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game-python-turtle
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
- The snake will automatically start moving in the right direction when the game begins.
- The objective is to eat as many food pellets as possible to score points and grow longer.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
- The game will display your current score at the top of the window.
- Press the "Esc" key to quit the game at any time.
